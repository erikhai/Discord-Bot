# Discord-Bot (Version 1.0.0)
This project was inspired from: https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-discord-bot-with-python
I found that their tutorial was easy to follow and understand regarding how to get started developing a Discord bot. Through further experimentation and trial and error I have finally developed a discord bot that is suitable for my daily life. Since I am a regular user of the platform, developing a bot was a fun experience, and is satisfying seeing my bot being functional in my severs.

## What did I learn from this project?
1. How to read and send messages to discord
2. Understanding how to use await and asynchro
3. Understanding how to extract JSON files and how to extract relevant data from them
4. Documentation skills and bug fixing

## What are my future plans for this project?
1. Properly incorporating the news feature
2. Using an AI chat bot that I have created myself

1. For jokes: https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/
